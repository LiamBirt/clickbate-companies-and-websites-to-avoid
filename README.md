Clickbait
1.) Miriam-Webster: something (such as a headline) designed to make readers want to click on a hyperlink especially when the link leads to content of dubious value or interest
It is difficult to remember a time when you could scroll through the social media outlet of your choice and not be bombarded with: You'll never believe what happened when … This is the cutest thing ever … This the biggest mistake you can make … Take this quiz to see which character you are on … They are all classic clickbait models.
— Emily Shire

2.) Wikipedia: Clickbait is a text or a thumbnail link that is designed to attract attention and to entice users to follow that link and read, view, or listen to the linked piece of online content, with a defining characteristic of being deceptive, typically sensationalized or misleading.[2][3] A "teaser" aims to exploit the "curiosity gap", providing just enough information to make readers of news websites curious, but not enough to satisfy their curiosity without clicking through to the linked content. Click-bait headlines add an element of dishonesty, using enticements that do not accurately reflect the content being delivered.[4][5][6] The "-bait" part of the term makes an analogy with fishing, where a hook is disguised by an enticement (bait), presenting the impression to the fish that it is a desirable thing to swallow.

Life-Information: One would traditionally call this "Data", and includes your name, contact information, locations in which you reside and work, loations in which you travel or venture, personal and professional networks that you've developed, preferences, subscriptions, purchases, health information and anything that one MIGHT consider PERSONAL. Whereas this information has been wrecklessly labelled as simply "Data" in the past, in light of recent events and knowledge of the dissemination and misuse of our personal, confidential and otherwise proprietary information - atleast for those residing within the United States - this information can simply not be categorized under the "data" umbrella. This information is what we rely on for subsistence in the digital world and as it stands - our life information is being used maliciously, fraudlulently and against the people resulting in financial, economic and social disdain and at times is diretly or indirectly linked to homicide and/or suicidie.
